<p>Hello! I'm Karina - my close friends and family call me Kern (not sure how they came up with that). I live in Berkeley, California, and work as an engineer in water and wastewater. I'm a proud dabbler - I love picking up new hobbies and skills. Currently, I like to spend my summers hiking, backpacking, and basking. In the winters, I like to cozy up with a craft (crocheting is my primary craft at the moment, but subject to change). I started my website as a journal of sorts to document my outdoor adventures and share some of the cool places I've been lucky enough to explore.</p>
