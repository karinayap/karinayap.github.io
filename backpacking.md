title: Backpack With Me!

<p> Backpacking is one of my favorite ways to explore the outdoors! I love being able to experience the solitutde of the backcountry, challenge myself with difficult hikes, and disconnect from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. I'm a diehard leave-no-trace girly - my number one priority on the trail is minimize impact so that we can continue to recreate responsibily and experience the wilderness. I try to review the trails that I have done with up-to-date information on trail conditions, weather, bugs, camping tips, and anything else I think is useful - catch me on <a href = "https://www.alltrails.com/members/karina-yap-1/reviews" target="_blank">AllTrails</a>!

<h2>My Typical Packing List</h2>
<p>This is definitely not a strict packing list, and I'll adjust it accordingly based on the needs of my trip and the people I'm going with, but here is a general list of the items that I'll bring with me on a typical trip.</p>
