<p>I have done trips on the American River a handful of times over the years (once on the Middle Fork, and once the year after on the South Fork). This year, the Middle Fork opened to rafting on Memorial Day weekend, and we booked our trip for the very next weekend. Our favorite outfitter is <a href="https://www.americanwhitewater.com/" target="_blank">American Whitewater Expeditions</a>! Our go-to is to camp at the AWE campsite the night before, and then meet our guide in the morning, shuttle to the put-in, and spend the day on the river.</p>

<h3>Day 1 - Camping</h3>
  <p>We drove up to the campsite in the late afternoon and were pretty thankful about how the timing worked out for us - it was a HOT day in the Central Valley so it was nice to get to camp right as the sun was starting to go down. We put up our tents, and explored the campground, looking mostly for the river access. There were a couple spots at the camp where we could head out to the South Fork and it was really nice to dip our feet in on such a hot day. After the sun went down, we hung out at camp for a bit and fell asleep under the stars (rainflys off! A summer treat!).</p>

	<h3>Day 2 - Rafting</h3>
	<p>We got up early the next morning, took down camp, had some coffee and a quick breakfast, and met up with the group around 8. We started rafting around 9 or 10 am, and the water felt amazing! The air was warm and the water was cool. The Middle Fork starts pretty fast with some big rapids right off the bat, and they were so thrilling and fun. Tunnel Chute is a big Class IV rapid through a tunnel created by miners from the gold rush, and this is on of the first rapids that we hit! Our guide had me ride through one of the rapids sitting right on the front of the raft - he called it "Bullrider" and that was a blast. We had lunch on the river around 1 pm, at which point we were all starving, and we went for a quick swim in the river. After lunch, we paddled through quite a few stretches of slow moving water, saw lots of fun birds (the mergansers were everywhere!), and we got more chances to swim through the river. We ended the day with a few more big rapids, then packed up the vans and drove back to camp. My favorite rapid of the day was called Parallel Parking.</p>
