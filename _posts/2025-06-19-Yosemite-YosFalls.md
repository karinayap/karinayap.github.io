<p>This trip was super special to me. We took some time off to do a longer trip and celebrate my birthday, and my brother and sister flew out to join! I loved being able to show them one of my favorite places in the world, and we made lots of memories together.</p>

<h3>Day 1</h3>
  <p>It was a hot day in the valley when we started our trip! We found the tiniest parking spot in the lot across the street from Camp 4, and by the time we crossed the street to the Upper Yosemite Falls trailhead we were already sweating. The Upper Yosemite Falls trail is no joke - it's a lot of elevation in about four miles, on a pretty exposed trail, with lots of loose rock and slippery granite. We took it slow, and got up to the top of the falls after four hours or so. We had originally planned to head west towards El Capitan, but at the trail junction we noticed lots of mosquitos starting to come out, so we decided to head east towards North Dome, where the trail is drier. We pressed on past the falls and the Yosemite Creek footbridge for about another 3-4 miles (racing daylight at this point) to top up water at Indian Canyon Creek, stopping only to observe a bear on the way to the creek. We considered continuing past the creek through the burn area, but it was getting dark, so we turned back to look for camp. We thought we would have to end up backtracking almost back to the junction, but my sister spotted a clearing through the trees that opened up to a perfect campsite.</p>

	<h3>Day 2</h3>
	<p>We had a nice slow morning the second day, with a morning campfire, coffee, and breakfast. I love a slow morning on backpacking trips, and definitely prefer it to waking up at the crack of dawn to immediately take down camp and start walking. We walked back out towards Yosemite Falls, stopping at Yosemite Point to take in the beauty of the valley, and then we decided that we would take a nice, relaxing day, and spend our afternoon waiting out the hottest time of the day by the river. We napped, basked, and ate lunch over the next few hours. We cold soaked instant hummus and made wraps with olives, pickles, sun-dried tomatoes, and Cheez-Its (non-negotiable). We left the river late in the afternoon, and once again decided to abandon our original plan of El Cap and head north following Yosmite Creek towards what appeared on the map to be some promising campsites. After wandering around for a while, we found a great campsite on a dome overlooking the river, with easy enough access to the river to make trips back and forth for water. We set up camp, enjoyed the sunset, had a small campfire, did some stargazing, and went to bed. </p>

	<h3>Day 3</h3>
	<p>Last day of the trip was all of the downhill, all at once. We woke up and it was super cold, so we left our tents almost as soon as the sun was out to start a campfire (around 5 am). We had breakfast and coffee, took down camp, and were on our way around 9:30 am. The Upper Yosmite Falls trail is a tough downhill too, and we argued about whether uphill or downhill tends to be worse. I'm of the camp that uphill is worse but our group was split 2/2. Our hike downhill was definitely faster, and less exhausting, but by the end of it my toes, calves, and ankles were definitely tired. Tough hike in both directions, but easier the second time around (I did this trip three years ago and it definitly felt worse then), and worth for the views!</p>
