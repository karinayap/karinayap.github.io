<p>Point Reyes National Seashore is less than a 2 hour drive from where we live, but I have never been able to snag a campsite reservation so up until this trip we were strictly day hikers. One of our good friends got a reservation at Coast Camp, so we got to tag along on a nice short weekend trip. There's no dispersed camping in Point Reyes (we have to stay at established campgrounds), so to me it doesn't feel as much like a wilderness experience, but I love the beautiful views of the California Coast, the easy hike out, the relatively short and easy drive, and of course getting to spend time with friends!</p>

<h3>Day 1</h3>
  <p>We parked at the Limantour Beach parking lot - there was quite a bit of space at this lot when we got there around 10 am. The marine layer was strong and I was definitely worried it was going to be cold and foggy all day. We had a short hike down the beach, and I brough my field guide and binoculars to do some birding on the way out. We saw lots of cool birds, including a pair of surf scooters out in the water! After maybe an hour walking down the beach, we cut up inland towards the campground, found our site, and dropped our stuff, then headed back down to spend a day relaxing on the beach. We played some spike ball, ate lunch, napped, and chatted all day. Truly a perfect beach day and a great way to catch up with some dear friends!</p>

	<h3>Day 2</h3>
	<p>I love waking up early on backpacking trips to enjoy the quiet and solitude of the mornings. I got up around 6 am - well before anyone else at the campground! I made my coffee, walked around the campground, saw some cool birds (lots of quails out in the mornings!), and enjoyed the peace. Once eveyrone else got up, we had a slow morning and packed up camp and started our walk back. This time, we walked along the Coast Trail for as much as we could before cutting back down to the beach and walkign the rest of the way to the parking lot. We stopped in Point Reyes Station on the way home for coffee and fresh cheese, and then made it back home to relax for the rest of the afternoon.</p>
