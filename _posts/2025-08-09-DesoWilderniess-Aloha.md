<div class="row">
<p>I did my first solo trip in Big Sur last year, and wanted to make that an annual trip. This weekend, Dylan was out of town, so I took the opportunity to go back to Desolation Wilderness on my own. I always enjoy a solo backpacking trip - I love getting to hike at my own pace, stop whenever I want, look at all the critters and plants along the way, and the feeling of self-sufficiency.</p>

<h3>Day 1</h3>
  <p>I hit the road at 5:30 am to try my luck at a walk up permit. I got to the ranger station and luckily there were plenty of permits available for Lake Aloha so I was quickly on my way to the trailhead. The first hiccup (really the only) of the day was that parking at the echo lake trailhead was an absolute zoo! I got to the trailhead around 9:30 and still had to circle around. Eventually I found a small street spot, chatted with the women who parked in front of me, and was on my way with an extra 1/2 mile between me and the trail. By the time I was on the trail, it was around 10:30! </p>

  <p>The trip started with 2.5 miles of relatively flat walking around lower and upper Echo lakes. I made a mental note to myself to shell out the $22 on the   water taxi on the way back. The water taxi takes you from echo lake chalet to basically the entrance to desolation wilderness and saves a lot of walking on pretty exposed trails, which is nice! I chatted with quite a few folks on the trail, including a group from Berkeley! Eventually I started the big climb up into desolation wilderness and I was feeling great and making pretty good progress. I stopped for lunch and took a quick detour to check out Tamarak lake, which was beautiful and super peaceful. I had a true hiker trash lunch of cold soaked couscous with a tuna packet mixed in, with some takis crushed up on top. I also munched on a small block of cheese from Cheeseboard. </p>

  <p>I felt pretty sluggish after lunch and still had a big climb ahead of me! My progress after lunch was much slower. I ended up taking a nice break in some shade (rare on this trail) and chatted with another hiker who recommended iced tea on the trail! He said the caffeine helps your muscles absorb the stuff you eat, and it tastes better than a Gu. I will definitely be trying that next time. </p>

  <p> I slowly finished the rest of the climb and after that it was pretty smooth sailing out to Lake Aloha. When I got to Aloha, I was pleasantly surprised! Folks on the trail had warned me it was super crowded, and while it definitely wasn’t the solitary backcountry experience I am used to it was not the tent city that I had come to expect. I found a nice flat spot at the northeast side of the lake, set up camp, and then went down for a nice swim while I chilled a can of Sprite in the lake (nature's fridge). I refilled my water bottles, contemplated dinner (decided I wasn’t hungry), sipped my Sprite, and meditated for a while. Eventually I retired to my tent to watch the sunset and go to bed.</p>

	<h3>Day 2</h3>
	<p>I woke up super early the next morning, watched the sunrise from my tent, and began the process of taking downw camp by myself. I decided to make a coffee, and while it cooled I packed up my tent, repacked my bags, and then sipped my coffee before I started my walk down. The hike out was smooooooth sailing, and I made really good time - about a 25 minute mile. I left my camp around 7:30 that morning and was down at the water taxi just before 9:30. I waited a bit for the boat, chatted witth some other folks taking the taxi, and enjoyed the boat ride back. I got back to the trailhead around 9:30 on the dot, walked back to my car, and was home in the early afternoon.</p>
