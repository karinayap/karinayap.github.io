<p>This was our first trip of the 2025 season! I love backpacking in Yosemite Valley before the summer heat gets too intense, and when the Half Dome cables are down it's even easier to get permits. That being said, we were still too late to get permits to stay at the LYV High Sierra Camp, so we ended up backpacking well past it towards Merced Lake. Our trip took us through the Lost Canyon and out towards Bunnell Cascade. AllTrails says this trip is about 8 miles each way, but my Fitbit definitely said it was closer to 14.</p>
<p>I have always found the amount of trash that backpacking generates to be at odds with my love for nature and the environment. This year, I've decided to be more mindful about trash and single-use plastic I'm using in my trips. So this is my first trip where I was really thinking about my trash, and it was definitely tricky! In the interest of keeping weight down, backpacking loves a Ziplock bag, or a single-serving pack of snacks. This was my first attempt at keeping trash to a minimum! It took a bit of creativity but I think I'm finding some things that work for me.</p>

    <h3>Day 1</h3>
    <p>We got up at 3:30 am to start the drive, and I was running a fever. After much deliberation, I decided I felt okay enough to go on the trip so long as someone else drove and I got to sleep for the entirety of the drive out. So I packed my hobbit lunch (a roll, a small block of cheese, and an apple wrapped in a bandana), filled up my water bottles, and we were on our way. On our way out, a giant rock on the highway smashed my windshield, which maybe was our second sign that this was not the best idea, but nevertheless we pushed forward (this would prove to be a running theme throughout the trip).</p>
    <p>We got to the wilderness station around 9:30 am, picked up our permits, and were told about a really nice trail maintenence campsite that existed out past Bunnell Cascade. We decided this was going to be our goal for the day. We started out on the Mist Trail, and climbed up the slippery granite stairs for what felt like horus. The Mist Trail was gorgeous, and both Vernal and Nevada Falls were gushing! We stopped at Vernal Falls, enjoyed our hobbit lunch, and napped for about two hours on some warm rocks by the water. Then we got up, put our packs back on, and pushed through the rest of the Mist Trail until we got to the top of the switchbacks that spit us out at Nevada Falls. At this point, my ibuprofen had kicked in (plus several naps in the car and by Vernal Falls) and I was feeling fantastic!</p>
    <p>After getting past Nevada Falls, the bulk of the climbing was over, and I thought we were home free. What I failed to realize was that flat miles are still miles, and after some tough inclines at the beginning of the day, and despite my adament denial still being kind of sick, after a while flat miles start to hurt. We walked for what felt like hours, past the LYV high sierra camp, through LYV, until we reached the Lost Valley. The Lost Valley had burned a few years back, so the trail was super exposed, and very shrubby. There are some day use restrictions in place, so we had a ways to go before we were even allowed to think about setting up camp, and even after existing the day use area, there weren't many great campsites and I was feeling quite poor. We walked and walked, got rattled at (agressively!) by a rattlesnake, saw several other snakes on the trail catching some sun, walked some more, until we finally reached Bunnell Cascade. We still had to walk a bit past Bunnell Cascade but we eventually found a nice flat granite slab around 6:30 pm. We set up camp, made dinner (instant pasta from the bulk section, with tomato sauce that I dehydrated using the food dehydrated I borrowed from the Berkeley tool lending library), sat by the fire, and went to bed.
