<div class="row">
<p>Desolation Wilderness is one of my favorite backpacking destinations in all of Northern California, and we were able to grab some last minute permits (+ one walk up permit) for a trip out to Middle Velma Lake!</p>

<h3>Day 1</h3>
  <p>We started our day pretty early and hit the road at 5:30 am, to get out to the Placerville Ranger Station to pick up one walk up permit for the Middle Velma Zone. We were successful, and headed out to the Bayview Trailhead to begin our hike. We were told that we looked like an REI ad, and then we were told that the mosquitos at Middle Velma were going to be brutal, and then it was straight into a pretty tough climb! We played the alphabet game on the way up, caught some amazing view of Lake Tahoe, and climbed and climbed until we took a wrong turn and eded up at Maggie's Peak (an unplanned, but welcome stop for lunch). After lunch, the rest of the hike was much easier - actually a gentle decline all the way down to the Velmas. We got distracted by a grouse call, met lots of cute pups, and made it to the Middle Velma by the late afternoon. We found a campsite and set down most of our stuff and went straight to the lake for a refreshing afternoon dip. We dried off in the sun (lizard time!), then went back and set up our camp. I had to check my hammock against Dylan's several times. Then the bugs started coming out, and we retreated to a granite slab to try to catch some of the wind and keep them at bay. We made dinner on our slab, tried to fend off the mosquitos to little avail, and then eventually went to hide in our hammocks until they went away. Once the sun went down and the bugs went to bed, we did some likely incorrect stargazing, and then went to bed. </p>

	<h3>Day 2</h3>
	<p>I woke up pretty early after a wonderful night's sleep in my hammock (as always). I got up, opened up the rain fly, and watched the sunrise from my hammock, which was a peak cozy experience. We took down camp, made our coffee, and then were on our way. The gentle climb out was nice and easy, and then the downhill along the Bayview trail was FAST. We made great time but still caught some traffic out of South Lake Tahoe on our way home. Overall this was an absolutely beautiful hike, and aside fom a tough 2 miles in the beginning it was a fairly moderate, high-reward trip!</p>
